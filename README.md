## Amazon Static Clone Page


This project is done for SRM ACM Web-Dev task. This project is a single static page of amazon's homepage. 

This website is made using HTML and CSS and has no javascipt.In this project, firsly the header and nav bar was created using the header and nav tag. Then the div tag comes into play followed by many sub div tags. In the sub div tags the logos are inserted using CDN library and the display was given flex to align all the logos in a straight line and background color was given. The background color code was taken from google.

Then a second panel was created under the nav bar with div tag consisitng of logos and text (similar to nav bar).In some areas select and option tag was used according to their necessities.

Then comes the main section of the page which has an static background image. The background image was fit to the size of the window.Then using the div tags, the boxes(4) were created occupying a space of 23% of the div tag evenly.Then using the para and div thing, content was written and pasted inside. 

Then comes the last section of the page which is the footer. Using the footer tag a panel was created just above the bottom of the page. When clicked on it, it redirects to the header of the page.
To conclude the project, more div tags and para tags were introduced to write the content.


## Lessons Learned


Honestly, this is the first time me building a clone website, let it be static. It was really a great challenge for me. It took me 2 days to build the website.

Using the div tag had always been a problem to me, snatching my lot of time, dont know why but it always confused me. But after building this website my all doubts have been cleared and i can use div tags like a pro.

Also i have learnt to use cdn libaries and linking it to my html file. The logos wouldnt have been possible without this. Thanks to google for helping me out with the logos. (All the code snippet was written by me and no references were taken for writing out the code.)

The main thing is that, I have learnt to sit myself for hours for developing a website no matter how hard it gets. Looking and just staring at the code for minutes to just get the output right was the real teacher. I wouldnt have learnt anything as better as I did, if I didnt solve the problem by myself.
